## What is Surfer SEO?

Founded in 2017, Surfer is an SEO and content optimization tool that promises to help you boost your visibility in Google, ChatGPT, and other AI search engines. It's actually a tool I've used for over three years now across two different content teams, and I find it to be a staple in any SEO or content marketer's workflow stack.

If you're creating editorial content for your website and want it to show up high in search results for specific keywords your audience is searching for, Surfer gives you a data-driven playbook. Instead of guessing what Google wants, you get concrete recommendations based on what's already ranking.

## How Surfer SEO Works

At its core, Surfer originally started as a content optimization tool, and this is widely what I've used it for in the past. Essentially, what you do is create reports based on certain keywords you want to go after, and Surfer helps you create a content outline based on your target keyword.

What the platform does is it scrapes through all the top-ranking pages for a given keyword, figures out what common keywords are used within those articles, and then spits them back out into your content brief inside of Surfer.

So you can write an article targeting a keyword that matches the correct intent and gives you a bunch of optimization recommendations like what keywords to include, how long the word count should be, how many headings you should ideally have, and so on. The editor shows you a real-time score that updates as you write, which is surprisingly motivating.

## How I Use Surfer SEO

As someone who's led content marketing and runs a media company, I think Surfer can be used by anybody that creates editorial SEO content. In my workflow, I start every new article by running a SERP analysis in Surfer for my target keyword.

Here's my actual process: I create a Content Editor document, scan the recommendations for heading structure and keyword targets, then write the first draft directly in Google Docs with the Surfer extension running. The real-time suggestions mean I'm optimizing as I write instead of going back later to retrofit SEO into finished content. For my team, this approach cut our optimization time from 2 hours per article down to about 20 minutes.

## Why It Matters

Here's why this matters for your workflow. First, you save hours of guesswork, so you can write with confidence that you're hitting the right SEO targets from the start. Second, the real-time scoring keeps you focused on search intent, so you can create content that actually ranks instead of just hoping it will. Third, if you're managing multiple writers, the brand voice feature ensures consistency, so you can scale content production without sacrificing quality or tone.

## AI Features

Since its optimization days, Surfer has launched new features like Surfer AI that helps you write content using AI in your own branded voice. It also now allows you to show up and optimize for AI chatbots like ChatGPT.

They also have a bunch of free tools like an AI content detector and an AI content humanizer. It's debatable on the accuracy of these tools, not just from Surfer but from pretty much any company out there. But it's nice that they include these for free, so you don't even need to be on a paid plan to get access.

In my experience, Surfer AI writes decent first drafts, but you absolutely need to edit them. It's not a replacement for a real writer, just a solid starting point.

## Who Should Use Surfer SEO?

If you're a solo content creator or small marketing team publishing 10 to 30 blog posts per month, Surfer's Essential plan is perfect. You'll get the core content editor, keyword research, and brand voice features that cover 90% of what you need. The Google Docs integration alone is worth it if that's where you already write.

If you're managing a team of 2 to 3 writers producing 40 to 80 articles monthly, the Scale plan makes sense. You'll appreciate the increased article limits and topical maps, so you can plan content clusters strategically instead of optimizing one article at a time.

However, if you're an absolute SEO beginner, Surfer won't teach you the fundamentals. As one Product Hunt user noted, "If you don't understand basic SEO, Surfer won't teach you. It assumes you know why keyword density and heading structure matter." If you're just starting out, consider taking an SEO course first or pairing Surfer with educational resources.

This is not for you if you need technical SEO tools. Surfer focuses purely on content optimization; there are no site audits, backlink analysis, or crawl error detection. If that's what you need, you'll still require Ahrefs or SEMrush alongside Surfer.

## Pricing Plans

Surfer has three pricing tiers, and you also get a 20% discount if you pay annually. But I'm going to list out the monthly prices below because that's generally what most people, like me, care about first.

Here are Surfer's plans:

**Essential** runs you $99 per month and gives you pretty much everything you need to generate reports and publish content optimized around specific keywords. You get 30 articles per month, the full content editor with real-time optimization, keyword research, SERP analyzer, and brand voice training. It's limited to one user seat, which is fine for solo creators.

**Scale** runs you $219 per month, and it gives you everything in Essential except you get five times higher limits. What this means is you'll get 100 articles per month, advanced topical maps to help you plan content strategy, the content audit tool to find optimization opportunities in your existing posts, and three user seats for team collaboration. You also get priority support.

**Enterprise** is totally custom pricing and tailored to whatever businesses need. You'll get everything in the Scale plan, but it also comes with white labeling, API access, and SSO logins, which are pretty important for larger organizations. From what I've seen, this typically starts around $500 to $1,000 per month depending on usage.

At small scale (one user creating 10 to 20 articles monthly), expect to pay $99 per month. At medium scale (two to three users producing 40 to 80 articles monthly), you're looking at $219 per month. Large teams with five or more users typically pay $500-plus or move to custom enterprise pricing.

## Pros

The content optimization reports are amazing. If you're looking to better optimize your existing content for SEO, it's an incredible feature that shows you exactly what's missing.

It integrates seamlessly with Google Docs and WordPress. I love the Google Docs integration because I write everything in a Google Doc, even this review you're reading right now. Having real-time SEO suggestions right there in my writing environment is a game changer, as one Reddit user put it.

Even on the basic Essential plan, you get brand voice training and team collaboration features if you're a larger company that cares about consistency. According to a G2 reviewer, "Brand voice feature is surprisingly good. Our articles sound consistent even when different team members write them."

It's a pretty big company and a trusted tool used by Intuit, Square, ClickUp, FedEx, FreshBooks, and tons more big companies. So I know nothing's going to break, and it has a team behind it that actually cares about the product.

## Cons

While Surfer is great and I use it regularly, I do think people should be careful using these kinds of tools without knowing any SEO fundamentals.

If you're a small startup, the entry-level $100-a-month plan might be a little too much, and there are alternatives in the space (albeit not as great) that are about half the price. One Capterra reviewer noted, "The price jumped significantly when we added our third team member. For small teams, it gets expensive fast compared to alternatives."

You need to have some sort of basic understanding of SEO to get the most out of the tool. If you're an absolute beginner, this is probably not a tool that's going to increase your skills by a magnitude of 10. What it really does is help you go from having an 80% ready-to-publish page to a 100% optimized page. But if you don't know how to get to that 80% on your own, then Surfer or really any other tool won't help you.

No technical SEO tools built in; the platform just focuses on creating and analyzing content. As one Reddit SEO specialist pointed out, "No technical SEO features at all. If you need site audits or backlink analysis, you'll still need Ahrefs or SEMrush."

### Migration Path

**If someone is switching FROM another tool TO Surfer:**

Most people come from Clearscope, Frase, or MarketMuse.

- Export your content calendar (manual copy or CSV)
- No data import needed (Surfer analyzes live SERPs, not historical data)
- Recreate brand voice settings (takes 30-60 minutes with sample articles)
- Timeline: Usually 1-2 hours to set up and familiarize
- Friction: Learning the interface if coming from a very different tool

**If someone is switching FROM Surfer TO another tool:**

- No export needed (your content lives in Google Docs or CMS, not Surfer)
- Lose: brand voice settings, saved content audits, topical maps
- Easy to migrate to: Clearscope, Frase (similar workflows)
- Timeline: Immediate (no vendor lock-in)

## Additional Context & Notes

**Personal Experience:**
I've used Surfer for 3 years across two different content teams. Started with Essential plan as a solo content marketer, upgraded to Scale when we hired two more writers. The Google Docs integration is legitimately the best feature because it fits into existing workflows seamlessly.

**Comparative Notes:**
- Better than Clearscope for: Real-time editing, brand voice
- Weaker than Frase for: Content briefs, question research
- Better than MarketMuse for: Ease of use, pricing transparency
- Weaker than SEMrush for: Technical SEO, keyword research depth

**Key Differentiators:**
- Google Docs integration (best in class)
- Brand voice feature (surprisingly good AI training)
- Content audit tool (finds optimization opportunities in existing content)
- No technical SEO features (pure content optimization focus)

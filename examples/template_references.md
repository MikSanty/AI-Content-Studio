## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Citation Format Guidelines

**EVERY source citation in your article MUST be a clickable hyperlink!**

### Correct Citation Format Examples:
```markdown
✅ "according to [Miquido UI/UX Trends](https://www.miquido.com/blog/ui-ux-design-trends/)"
✅ "as [Userpilot SaaS Research](https://userpilot.com/blog/saas-landing-pages/) reports"
✅ "[TechRadar's review](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/product-name) shows that..."
✅ "Data from [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/article-name/) indicates..."
```

### Incorrect Citation Format Examples:
```markdown
❌ "according to Miquido UI/UX Trends" (NO HYPERLINK)
❌ "as various studies show" (TOO VAGUE, NO SOURCE)
❌ "according to [Miquido](https://miquido.com/trends)" (WRONG/INVENTED URL)
❌ "[Source: Company Research]" (NOT A CLICKABLE LINK)
```

### Quick Reference URL Mapping
When you add sources below, create a mapping table for easy reference:

| Source Name | Exact URL to Use |
|-------------|------------------|
| Example Source 1 | https://www.example.com/article1 |
| Example Source 2 | https://www.example.com/article2 |
| Example Source 3 | https://www.example.com/article3 |

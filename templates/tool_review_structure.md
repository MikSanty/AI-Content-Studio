## How [Tool] Works

**Purpose:** Detail the core mechanics and provide a copyable workflow

**Requirements:**
- Show steps a reader can follow now
- Format: setup → trigger → outcome
- Keep it practical, not abstract
- 200-350 words
- Use concrete examples

**Structure:**
- Explain the core mechanism

- Mention key features in action

**Example format:**
"At its core, [Tool] works by [core mechanism]. Essentially, what you do is [step 1], and [Tool] helps you [step 2] based off [input].

What the platform does is it [technical process], and then [output/result].

So you can [outcome] that is [benefit]."

---

## How I Use [Tool] (or Case Study)

**Purpose:** Personal narrative or realistic workflow

**Requirements:**
- First-person storytelling
- Setup used
- Problem it solved
- Result achieved
- 150-300 words

**Storytelling note:**
If you have a personal use case or workflow, reference it here. If not, generate a realistic founder-style use case to ground the review.

**Example approach:**
"As someone who's led content marketing, started an SEO agency, and runs a media company (the one you're reading on right now), I think [Tool] can actually be used for [use case].

In my workflow, I [specific usage]. For example, [concrete example with outcome]."

---

## Why It Matters

**Purpose:** Highlight reader outcomes phrased as "so you can..."

**Requirements:**
- 3-5 reader outcomes
- Tie capabilities to business results
- Use "so you can..." phrasing
- 100-200 words

**Format:**
Use this structure:
- "[Feature/capability], so you can [business outcome]"
- "[Feature/capability], so you can [business outcome]"

**Storytelling note:**
If you have a real example of an outcome or business impact, reference it here.

**Example:**
"Here's why this matters for your workflow:
- [Feature] so you can [save 10 hours per week]
- [Feature] so you can [rank higher without guessing]
- [Feature] so you can [scale content without sacrificing quality]"

---

## AI Features (Optional)

**Purpose:** Explain what the AI does, how useful it is in practice, and where it falls short

**Requirements:**
- Only include if the tool has AI features
- Explain what the AI actually does
- Honest assessment of usefulness
- Note limitations
- 100-200 words

**Example:**
"Since its optimization days, [Tool] has launched new features like [Tool] AI that helps you write content using AI in your own branded voice, and it also now allows you to show up and optimize for AI chatbots.

They also have a bunch of free tools like an AI content detector tool and an AI content humanizer tool. Again, it's debatable on the accuracy of these tools, not just from [Tool] but from pretty much any company out there. But it's nice if they include these for free, so you don't even need to be on a paid plan to get access to it."

---

## Who Should Use [Tool]?

**Purpose:** Define fit by stage/team using conditional framing

**Requirements:**
- Use "If you're X... if you're Y..." pattern
- Define when it's "enough" vs when you outgrow it
- Mention alternative migration paths
- 200-300 words
- 2-4 targeted mini callouts with conditional language

**Conditional framing examples:**
- "If you're a solo founder, you'll get X; if you're already post-PMF, you'll likely want Y."
- "If you need deep customization, consider Z; if speed matters, this tool wins."

**Storytelling note:**
If you have past experience or comparative thoughts ("if you're X, this works; if you're Y, it doesn't"), reference it here.

**Example structure:**
"[Tool] is for [primary persona] that [specific need].

If you're [scenario 1], this is perfect because [reason]. You'll appreciate [capability] so you can [outcome].

If you're [scenario 2], you might find [limitation] frustrating, where [alternative tool] does better.

This is NOT for you if [exclusion criteria]."

## Pricing Plans

**Purpose:** Transparent pricing breakdown with scaling clarity

**Requirements:**
- Free tier limits (if applicable)
- Paid starter plan details
- Scaling model explained (subscribers, seats, projects, traffic)
- How costs evolve at small / medium / large usage
- 200-350 words
- Actual numbers and specifics

**Structure:**
"[Tool] has [number] pricing tiers, and you also get a [discount info] if you pay annually, but I'm going to just list out the monthly prices below because that's generally what most people, like me, care about first.

Here are [Tool]'s plans:

**[Plan Name]:**
- Price: $X per month
- What you get: [specific limits and features]
- Best for: [usage scenario]

**[Plan Name]:**
- Price: $X per month
- What you get: [specific limits and features]
- Best for: [usage scenario]

**Scaling:**
At small scale (X users/projects), expect $X/month.
At medium scale (X users/projects), you're looking at $X/month.
Large teams typically pay $X+ or move to custom enterprise pricing."

---

## Pros

**Purpose:** Strengths framed as reader outcomes

**Requirements:**
- 4-6 specific pros
- Frame as outcomes, not just features
- Concrete and testable
- 100-150 words

**Format:**
Use bullet points:
- [Specific pro with context and outcome]
- [Specific pro with context and outcome]

**Example:**
"Pros:
- The content optimization reports are amazing. If you're looking to better optimize your existing content for SEO, it's an amazing feature.
- It can easily integrate with Google Docs or WordPress. I love the Google Docs integration because I write everything in a Google Doc.
- If you're a larger company that cares about your brand voice and collaboration, even on the basic Essential plan you get both of those things."

---

## Cons

**Purpose:** Real constraints and tradeoffs

**Requirements:**
- 3-5 honest limitations
- Frame as tradeoffs, not just negatives
- Help reader understand when it's a dealbreaker
- 100-150 words

**Example:**
"Cons:
- If you're a small startup, the entry-level $100-a-month plan might be a little bit too much, and there are alternatives in the space (albeit not as great) that are about half the price.
- You need to have some sort of basic understanding of SEO to get the most out of the tool. If you're an absolute beginner, this is probably not a tool that's going to increase your skills by a magnitude of 10.
- No technical SEO tools built in, the platform just focuses on creating and analyzing content."

---

## Caveats (Optional)

**Purpose:** Hidden costs, missing features, support quirks

**Requirements:**
- Only include if there are notable caveats
- Be specific about hidden costs or limitations
- 50-100 words

**Example:**
"A few things to watch out for:
- The article limit resets monthly, not rolling
- Overage charges can add up quickly if you go over your plan limits
- Support response times vary significantly by plan tier"

---

## Ratings & Reviews

**Purpose:** Cite third-party validation with links

**Requirements:**
- Include G2 and Capterra (when they exist)
- Add Product Hunt and Trustpilot when relevant
- Provide actual ratings and review counts
- Include links in the Sources section
- 50-100 words

**Format:**
"Now let's check out some reviews of [Tool] from third-party websites:
- **G2:** [X.X] out of 5 stars (from [XXX] user reviews)
- **Capterra:** [X.X] out of 5 stars (from [XXX] user reviews)
- **Product Hunt:** [X] upvotes (launched [Month Year])

As you can see, [Tool] is a [solid/mixed/highly-rated] tool with [characterization] reviews from others. I recommend checking it out if you're looking for something like this. They have a [X]-day money-back guarantee too, so there's no huge risk in trying it out."

- Number sequentially [1], [2], [3], etc.

### Divider Lines
- DO NOT use divider lines (---, ***, etc.)
- Use section headers to separate content

### Word Count
- Target: 900-1,400 words (soft range, not hard limit)
- Expand sections as needed until reader could decide
- Quality and completeness > hitting exact word count

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Narrative Voice
- Use first-person ("I've found", "In my experience")
- Include personal judgments sparingly (once per major section at most)

### Conditional Framing
- Use 2-4 targeted mini callouts
- "If you're a [persona], you'll get [X]; if you're [alt persona], [Y]"
- "Better than [Alt] for [X]; weaker than [Alt] for [Y]"

### Comparative Guidance
- State exclusions clearly: "This is not for you if..."
- Provide tradeoffs: "Strong for [X], weak for [Y]"

### Recommendation Snapshot
- Close with brief guidance
- "Best for: ..."
- "Use instead if: ..."
- "Upgrade when: ..."

### Practical Outcomes
- Tie every opinion to user outcome
- "so you can launch faster, validate sooner, spend less"

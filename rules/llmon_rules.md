   - Adjust sentence length distribution
   - Change rhythm and pacing

2. **Word Choice**
   - Formal vs. conversational language
   - Technical vs. accessible terminology
   - Abstract vs. concrete descriptions

3. **Tone Modulation**
   - Authoritative vs. collaborative
   - Direct vs. exploratory
   - Serious vs. engaging

4. **Engagement Style**
   - Data-driven vs. story-driven
   - Instructive vs. thought-provoking
   - Straightforward vs. nuanced

### Create Distinct Variations
Each variation should feel notably different:

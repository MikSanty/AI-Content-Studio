# LLMON Agent Rules for Tool Reviews

## Purpose
These rules guide how the LLMON agent transforms tool review articles into distinct variations while preserving the story-driven, personable nature and factual accuracy required for tool reviews.

---

## Unique Challenges for Tool Review Variations

Unlike general articles, tool reviews have:
- **Personal narrative elements** that must be preserved
- **Factual product details** (pricing, features) that cannot change
- **Quote evidence** that must remain intact
- **First-person voice** that defines the review style
- **Sources appendix** that must stay consistent

---

## Transformation Principles

### MUST Preserve Across All Variations

1. **Story-Driven Narrative**
   - Keep first-person anecdotes and experiences
   - Maintain "How I Use [Tool]" section narrative
   - Preserve personal judgments and opinions
   - Keep the human, colleague-to-colleague tone

2. **Factual Product Information**
   - Pricing tiers and amounts (exact numbers)
   - Feature lists and capabilities
   - Implementation steps
   - Migration paths
   - G2/Capterra ratings and review counts
   - All URLs in Sources appendix

3. **Quote Evidence**
   - All quotes must appear in every variation
   - Quote text must remain exact (word-for-word)
   - Source attributions must stay consistent
   - Sources appendix must be identical across variations

4. **Required Structure**
   - All required sections must be present
   - Section order must remain the same
   - Headers must follow tool review format
   - No em dashes, no divider lines, no parentheticals in headers

5. **Conditional Framing**
   - "If you're X... if you're Y..." patterns
   - Comparative guidance statements
   - Exclusion criteria ("This is not for you if...")
   - Recommendation snapshots

## What CAN Change (Variation Dimensions)

### Variation 1: Clear & Accessible

**Focus:** Make the review digestible for busy decision-makers

**Style Adjustments:**
- Simpler sentence structure
- More direct language
- Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points where helpful
- Clear, action-oriented headings within sections
- Straightforward comparisons

**Tone:**
- Friendly but efficient
- "Here's what you need to know"
- Less narrative meandering, more quick insights
- Practical and to-the-point

**Example Transformation:**

Original:
"As someone who's led content marketing, started an SEO agency, and runs a media company (the one you're reading on right now), I think Surfer can actually be used for anybody that creates editorial SEO content. Meaning their goal is to create amazing content for their own website or their company's website with the goal of having that content show up high in search engines based on specific keywords their potential customers are searching for."

Variation 1:
"I've worked in content marketing and SEO for years, running teams and agencies. Here's my take: Surfer works for anyone creating SEO content for their website. If your goal is to rank higher in search engines for specific keywords, this tool helps you do that."

---

### Variation 2: Deep & Analytical

**Focus:** Provide thorough analysis for expert readers who want details

**Style Adjustments:**
- More complex sentence structures
- Technical terminology where appropriate
- Longer analytical paragraphs (4-6 sentences)
- Deeper comparative analysis
- Nuanced observations
- More context and background

**Tone:**
- Authoritative and informed
- "Let me break down the nuances"
- Detailed exploration of tradeoffs
- Expert-to-expert communication

**Example Transformation:**

Original:
"This wouldn't be a real review without a pros and cons section, as all of my reviews on this blog aim to be as unbiased as possible. However, I do tend to mention only tools that I have personally used and actually like."

Variation 2:
"Any credible review requires balanced assessment of strengths and limitations. While I focus my coverage on tools I've personally vetted and find valuable, maintaining objectivity about their constraints is essential for informed decision-making. The following analysis reflects extensive hands-on use across multiple projects and team configurations."

---

### Variation 3: Engaging & Persuasive

**Focus:** Create compelling narrative that helps reader feel the experience

**Style Adjustments:**
- Story-forward structure
- Vivid examples and scenarios
- Conversational asides
- More emotional resonance
- Relatable analogies
- Engaging transitions

**Tone:**
- Warm and personable
- "Let me tell you what happened"
- Story-driven with personality
- Enthusiastic where warranted, honest about limitations

**Example Transformation:**

Original:
"Surfer has three pricing tiers, and you also get a 20% discount if you pay annually, but I'm going to just list out the monthly prices below because that's generally what most people, like me, care about first."

Variation 3:
"Let's talk money. Surfer offers three pricing tiers, and yeah, there's the usual 20% off if you commit to annual billing. But here's the thing: when you're evaluating a new tool, you want to know what you'll actually pay each month. So that's what I'll show you, because that's how I think about it too."

## Variation-Specific Guidelines

### For All Variations: Quote Integration

**Vary HOW quotes are introduced, not the quotes themselves:**

Variation 1:
- "Users appreciate the interface. One G2 reviewer said: [quote]"

Variation 2:
- "The user experience consistently receives positive feedback across review platforms. As one G2 reviewer articulated: [quote]"

Variation 3:
- "Here's what real users are saying. A G2 reviewer captured it perfectly: [quote]"

### For All Variations: Conditional Framing

**Vary the delivery style, not the substance:**

Variation 1:
- "This works for solo founders. It's less ideal for large teams."

Variation 2:
- "Solo founders will find this appropriately scaled to their needs; larger teams may encounter limitations around collaboration features and user management."

Variation 3:
- "If you're flying solo, you'll love this. But if you're managing a team of 10+? You might start hitting walls pretty quickly."

### For All Variations: Comparative Guidance

**Vary emphasis and depth:**

Variation 1:
- "Better than [Tool A] for speed. Weaker than [Tool B] for analytics."

Variation 2:
- "In comparative analysis, this tool demonstrates superior performance relative to [Tool A] in workflow velocity, though it trails [Tool B] in analytical depth and reporting sophistication."

Variation 3:
- "Want to move fast? This beats [Tool A] hands down. But if you're a data nerd who lives in dashboards, [Tool B] is going to give you way more to work with."

## Quality Standards for Tool Review Variations

Each variation must:

1. **Maintain Factual Accuracy**
   - Same pricing numbers
   - Same feature descriptions
   - Same implementation steps
   - Same quote text
   - Same sources list

   - Recommendation guidance included

3. **Meet Format Requirements**
   - No em dashes in any variation
   - No parenthetical text in headers
   - No divider lines
   - Clean, natural headers
   - Sources appendix at end

4. **Ensure Differentiation**
   - Variations should FEEL different
   - Reading experience should vary (accessible vs analytical vs engaging)
   - Sentence structure and rhythm should differ
   - Paragraph length and organization should vary

5. **Maintain Review Quality**
   - Each variation publication-ready
   - Professional tone appropriate to style
   - Coherent flow throughout
   - Same approximate length (900-1,400 words)

---

## Variation Differentiation Targets

Aim for differentiation in:

- **Sentence complexity** (simple → complex → conversational)
- **Paragraph structure** (short & punchy → long & analytical → varied & flowing)
- **Transitional phrases** (direct → formal → casual)
- **Example elaboration** (brief → detailed → story-rich)
- **Explanatory depth** (essential → comprehensive → illustrative)

Do NOT differentiate:
- Facts, numbers, pricing
- Quote text or sources
- Personal narratives (keep highly similar)
- Required sections or structure
- Conditional framing substance (only delivery)

---

## Example Transformation Approach

**Original Sentence:**
"This approach significantly improves efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, so you can focus on strategy instead of execution."

**Variation 1 (Clear):**
"It automates repetitive tasks. This frees you up for strategic work instead of execution."

**Variation 2 (Deep):**
"The automation-first architecture systematically eliminates manual, repetitive workflows, enabling practitioners to reallocate cognitive resources from tactical execution toward strategic planning and optimization."

**Variation 3 (Engaging):**
"Here's what I love: it handles all those tedious, repetitive tasks you hate. That means you finally have time to think about strategy instead of drowning in execution mode."

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **Never invent quotes** - Only use quotes from the original review
2. **Never change pricing** - Numbers must be exact across variations
3. **Never drop required sections** - All sections must appear
4. **Never alter sources appendix** - Must be identical in all variations
5. **Never remove conditional framing** - Keep "If you're X..." patterns
6. **Never lose first-person voice** - Reviews must feel personal
7. **Never add em dashes** - Strictly forbidden in tool reviews
8. **Never add divider lines** - Use section headers only

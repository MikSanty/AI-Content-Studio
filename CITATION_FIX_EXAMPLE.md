# Citation Fix - Before & After Example

## The Problem (Before)

### What the Writer Agent Generated:
```markdown
The stakes are incredibly high, with user expectations continually rising. 
Data reveals that nearly 50% of users abandon a page if it takes more than 
2 seconds to load, a critical metric for 2025, according to Miquido UI/UX Trends.
```

### Issues:
- ‚ùå "according to Miquido UI/UX Trends" has NO hyperlink
- ‚ùå Readers can't click to verify the source
- ‚ùå Hurts SEO and credibility
- ‚ùå Unprofessional appearance

## The Solution (After)

### What the Writer Agent Should Generate:
```markdown
The stakes are incredibly high, with user expectations continually rising. 
Data reveals that nearly 50% of users abandon a page if it takes more than 
2 seconds to load, a critical metric for 2025, according to 
[Miquido UI/UX Trends](https://www.miquido.com/blog/ui-ux-design-trends/).
```

### Benefits:
- ‚úì Clickable hyperlink to actual source
- ‚úì Readers can verify claims easily
- ‚úì Better SEO through proper linking
- ‚úì Professional, credible appearance
- ‚úì Matches best practices for web content

## How the Fix Works

### 1. Enhanced Prompts Tell the Writer Agent:
```
CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
**EVERY source citation MUST be a properly hyperlinked markdown link:**
- Convert ALL source mentions to format: [Source Name](exact_url)
- Use ONLY the exact URLs from the REFERENCE MATERIALS section below
- NEVER invent, modify, guess, or hallucinate URLs

Mandatory Format:
‚úì "according to [Miquido UI/UX Trends](https://www.miquido.com/blog/ui-ux-design-trends/)"
‚úó "according to Miquido UI/UX Trends" (NO HYPERLINK - UNACCEPTABLE)
```

### 2. Citation Validator Catches Mistakes:
```
======================================================================
CITATION VALIDATION REPORT
======================================================================

Status: [FAILED]

ISSUES FOUND:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. MISSING_HYPERLINK
   Line: 5
   Citation lacks hyperlink: 'Miquido UI/UX Trends'
   Source: Miquido UI/UX Trends
```

### 3. Workflow Memory Learns:
After you've rejected drafts 2+ times for citation issues:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Citation & Hyperlink Requirements

USER HAS REPEATEDLY FLAGGED CITATION ISSUES:
- User has flagged citation issues 3 times
- Missing hyperlinks on source citations

MANDATORY ACTIONS:
1. Convert ALL source citations to hyperlinked markdown
2. NEVER write 'according to Source' without hyperlink
```

## Real-World Test Result

We tested the validator on your actual draft file `outputs/20251015_102405/01_writer_draft.md`:

```
Status: [FAILED]

ISSUES FOUND:

1. MISSING_HYPERLINK
   Line: 5
   Citation lacks hyperlink: 'Miquido UI/UX Trends'

2. MISSING_HYPERLINK
   Line: 17
   Citation lacks hyperlink: 'Userpilot SaaS Research'
```

**This proves the system correctly identifies exactly the problems you reported!**

## Expected Workflow Now

1. You fill out `manual.md` and `references.md` as usual
2. Writer agent generates draft with enhanced citation instructions
3. **NEW:** Citation validator automatically runs
4. **NEW:** You see validation report with any issues
5. If FAILED, you request revisions: "Fix the missing hyperlinks"
6. Writer agent revises with even stronger citation reminders
7. Validator runs again
8. Repeat until PASSED
9. Continue to LLMON and Editor stages

## Best Practices for Your references.md

### Old Format (Vague):
```markdown
## Sources
- Miquido UI/UX Trends article
- Userpilot research on SaaS
```

### New Format (Clear):
```markdown
## Source Materials with URLs

1. **Miquido UI/UX Trends** - https://www.miquido.com/blog/ui-ux-design-trends/
   - Top 10 UI/UX Design Trends for 2025
   
2. **Userpilot SaaS Research** - https://userpilot.com/blog/saas-landing-pages/
   - SaaS landing page best practices and conversion data
```

This makes it crystal clear which URL to use for each source!

## Quick Start

1. **Update your references.md** to use the new format (see `examples/template_references.md`)
2. **Run the workflow** as normal: `python main.py`
3. **Watch for citation validation** reports after draft generation
4. **Review any issues** and request fixes if needed
5. **Approve when PASSED** and all citations are properly linked

The system now has your back on citation quality! üéØ
